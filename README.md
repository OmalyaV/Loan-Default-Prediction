# CS3111 - Introduction to Machine Learning: Feature Engineering Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for the "Feature Engineering" assignment for the CS3111 - Introduction to Machine Learning course. The assignment focuses on applying various data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to develop a machine learning classification model for loan default prediction.

## Assignment Details
- **Course**: CS3111 - Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Assignment**: Lab 01 - Feature Engineering
- **Instructor**: Dr. R.T. Uthayasanker
- **Due Date**: 29 February 2024 by 11:59 PM

## Files Included
- `DataDictionary.xlsx`: Contains the details, definitions, and descriptions of the features in the dataset.
- `train.csv`: Training data with features and target column ('loan status').
- `valid.csv`: Validation data with features and target column ('loan status').
- `X test.csv`: Test data with features but without the target column.
- `210001X.csv`: Sample submission file for the test data with predicted labels and selected features.
- `210001X report.pdf`: Sample report file containing feature engineering techniques, Python notebook link, code snippets, and SHAP analysis.

## Assignment Tasks
1. **Feature Selection / Removal**: Utilize data cleaning and feature scoring techniques.
2. **Feature Encoding**: Transform categorical variables into numerical representations.
3. **Feature Crossing**: Create new features by combining existing ones.
4. **Advanced Feature Engineering Techniques**: Apply additional techniques for feature enhancement.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce the number of features while preserving predictive power.
6. **Model Development**: Train an XGBoost Classifier using the training data and evaluate its performance on the validation set.

## Evaluation
- Transform test data features using developed feature engineering techniques.
- Submit a CSV file with the final set of features for the test data.
- Include SHAP analysis for explainable AI in the report.
